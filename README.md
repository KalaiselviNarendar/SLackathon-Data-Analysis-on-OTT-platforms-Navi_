## Short description
  OTT platforms are becomming much more popular. So, nowadays many people are started using OTT platforms instead of old cable TV connections. There comes the need for identifying which OTT platform used more, based on the interest and needs of the customer. Based on the historic data, in this project I am going to identify which OTT was most commonly used.
  
### What's the problem?
  As many people are started using OTT platform there is a need to identify which factors increases amount of content consumed on those platform by customers.  
  Just like Televisions, based on analysis which program can be telecasted on peak hours similarly need to identify which factors increase the time spent on a particular OTT platform.

### How can technology help?
With the help of data analysis we can identify which factors are affecting the time spend on a particular OTT platform and with this they can make changes to increase the time spend.

### The idea
Using Historical data we can train the machine learning model and predict the factor to increase the timespend. With this we can easily identify the interest of the people based on geographical location, age and hours spend by them on a particular OTT platform.
Based on the analysis OTT platforms can focus on the facts and makes use of them to increase the time spend for their particular OTT platforms and make more use of it.
