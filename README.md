## Short description
  OTT platforms are becomming much more popular. So, nowadays many people are started using OTT platforms instead of old cable TV connections. There comes the need for identifying which OTT platform used more, based on the interest and needs of the customer. Based on the historic data, in this project I am going to identify which OTT was most commonly used.
  
### What's the problem?
  As many people are started using OTT platform there is a need to identify which factors increases amount of content consumed on those platform by customers.  
  Just like Televisions, based on analysis which program can be telecasted on peak hours similarly need to identify which factors increase the time spent on an particular OTT platform.
